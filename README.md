# python-mini-projects

A collection of mini projects to improve my skills.

I’m planning to add one mini project every day (at least that’s my decision — let’s see how it goes).

I realized I need to strengthen my fundamental Python knowledge, so this repository will include simple exercises all the way up to more complex ones. If you have any ideas or good practice suggestions, feel free to contact me — we can improve our skills together.

Let’s start!
